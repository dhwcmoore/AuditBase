# Veribound Process Architecture

A mathematically verified boundary classification system for critical applications in healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and nuclear safety.

## What is Veribound?

Veribound classifies numeric values into predefined categories with mathematical certainty. The system takes a domain and a numeric value, then returns which boundary category contains that value.

**Example**: Classify a blood glucose reading
```bash
dune exec -- bin/main.exe inspect diabetes 6.0
# Returns: Prediabetes
```

**Why this matters**: In critical systems, incorrect classifications can be catastrophic. Traditional boundary logic uses ad-hoc if/else statements scattered throughout codebases with no formal guarantees. Veribound centralizes this logic into a mathematically verified framework where the classification algorithms are backed by formal proofs.

**Mathematical verification means**: The core classification logic is proven correct using Coq theorem prover. This guarantees that floating-point edge cases, boundary overlaps, and classification algorithms behave exactly as specified.

## How Boundaries Work

Each domain defines ranges that map values to categories:

```
Diabetes Classification (HbA1c %):
[0.0────────70.0]───[100.0]───[126.0────400.0]
     Low         Normal   Prediabetic   Diabetic
                      ↑
               Your value: 6.0 → Prediabetic
```

The system mathematically verifies that every value maps to exactly one category.

## Quick Start

Build the system:
```bash
dune build
```

Try a classification:
```bash
dune exec -- bin/main.exe inspect diabetes 6.0
```

Test all domains:
```bash
dune exec -- bin/main.exe test-pipeline --all-domains
```

## Example Classifications

### Diabetes (HbA1c percentage)
```bash
dune exec -- bin/main.exe inspect diabetes 5.0   # Returns: Normal
dune exec -- bin/main.exe inspect diabetes 6.0   # Returns: Prediabetes  
dune exec -- bin/main.exe inspect diabetes 7.0   # Returns: Diabetes
dune exec -- bin/main.exe inspect diabetes 12.0  # Returns: Diabetes
```

### Blood Pressure (systolic mmHg)
```bash
dune exec -- bin/main.exe inspect blood_pressure 90.0   # Returns: Normal
dune exec -- bin/main.exe inspect blood_pressure 140.0  # Returns: High
```

### Air Quality Index
```bash
dune exec -- bin/main.exe inspect aqi 50.0   # Returns: Moderate
dune exec -- bin/main.exe inspect aqi 150.0  # Returns: Unhealthy
```

### Financial Risk (Basel III capital ratios)
```bash
dune exec -- bin/main.exe inspect basel_iii_capital_adequacy 8.0   # Returns: Adequate
dune exec -- bin/main.exe inspect basel_iii_capital_adequacy 6.0   # Returns: Undercapitalized
```

## Commands

### Inspect
Classify a single value within a domain:
```bash
dune exec -- bin/main.exe inspect DOMAIN VALUE
```

### Verify
Check domain structure and boundary definitions:
```bash
dune exec -- bin/main.exe verify DOMAIN
dune exec -- bin/main.exe verify diabetes
```

### Test Pipeline
Test classification across domains:
```bash
dune exec -- bin/main.exe test-pipeline --all-domains
```

Add `--show-process` to any command to see detailed processing steps.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**Engine Interface** (`mathematical_extraction/engine_interface/`)
- Domain Manager: YAML-based domain definition loading
- Boundary Classifier: Real-time classification engine
- Type-safe OCaml interfaces with mathematical verification

**Runtime Classifier** (`classification_runtime/boundary_engine/`)
- High-performance classification runtime
- Support for simple domain boundaries
- Confidence scoring and engine identification

**Mathematical Verification** (`mathematical_extraction/flocq_proofs/`)
- Coq-based mathematical proofs

### Classification Process

1. **Parse command**: Extract domain name and numeric value
2. **Load domain**: Read YAML boundary definitions from `boundary_logic/domain_definitions/`
3. **Validate input**: Check value is numeric and within global bounds
4. **Classify**: Apply mathematically verified boundary logic
5. **Return result**: Structured classification with confidence scoring

### Domain Definition Format

Domains are defined in YAML format:

```yaml
name: "Blood Glucose"
unit: "mg/dL" 
description: "Blood glucose level classification"
global_bounds: [0.0, 400.0]
boundaries:
  - range: [0.0, 70.0]
    category: "Low"
    color: "red"
  - range: [70.0, 100.0]  
    category: "Normal"
    color: "green"
  - range: [100.0, 126.0]
    category: "Prediabetic" 
    color: "yellow"
  - range: [126.0, 400.0]
    category: "Diabetic"
    color: "red"
```

### Classification Results

The system returns structured results:

```ocaml
type classification_result = {
  input_value: string;    (* Input value as string *)
  category: string;       (* Classification category *)
  confidence: string;     (* Confidence level *)
  engine: string;         (* Classification engine used *)
}
```

Example output:
```
Classification Result for diabetes = 6.00:
  Category: Prediabetes
  Confidence: Runtime_Fast
```

## Contributing

### Adding New Domains

1. Create a YAML file in `boundary_logic/domain_definitions/`
2. Follow the standard domain definition format
3. Test the domain: `dune exec -- bin/main.exe verify <domain_name>`
4. Run the full test suite: `dune build @all`

### Domain Definition Guidelines

- Boundaries must be non-overlapping and complete
- Global bounds should encompass all valid input values
- Categories should be meaningful for the domain
- Include appropriate units and descriptions

### Testing

Test individual domains:
```bash
dune exec -- bin/main.exe verify diabetes
```

Test all domains:
```bash
dune exec -- bin/main.exe test-pipeline --all-domains
```

Run the complete build and test suite:
```bash
dune build @all
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What makes this different from simple if/else statements?**
Mathematical proofs guarantee correctness even with floating-point edge cases, boundary overlaps, and complex domain logic. Traditional approaches have no formal guarantees.

**Can I modify existing domain boundaries?**
Yes. Edit the YAML files in `boundary_logic/domain_definitions/` and verify with the `verify` command. The mathematical verification ensures the classification logic remains correct.

**How do I add custom domains?**
Create a YAML file following the domain definition format, place it in the domain definitions directory, and verify it loads correctly.

**What happens with edge cases and floating-point precision?**
The Coq proofs handle floating-point edge cases mathematically. The Flocq library ensures numerical operations behave correctly at boundary edges.

**Is this suitable for real-time applications?**
Yes. The runtime classifier is designed for high-performance classification with confidence scoring.
